# Single Controller Simplification - Complete

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Deleted `FittingRoomController`
- ❌ Removed: `Fashion.Api/Controllers/FittingRoomController.cs`
- ✅ Reason: Simplified to one controller only

### 2. Enhanced `FittingRoomRequestController`
- ✅ Added: `IFittingRoomManagementService` dependency
- ✅ Added: Fitting room management endpoints
- ✅ Organized: Endpoints by user type (Customer/Manager)

## 📋 New Single Controller Structure

### Route: `/api/fitting-room-requests`

#### Customer Endpoints:
- `POST /api/fitting-room-requests` - Create request
- `GET /api/fitting-room-requests/my-requests` - Get my requests

#### Manager Endpoints:
- `GET /api/fitting-room-requests` - Get all requests
- `GET /api/fitting-room-requests/status/{status}` - Get requests by status
- `GET /api/fitting-room-requests/{requestId}` - Get specific request
- `PUT /api/fitting-room-requests/{requestId}` - Update request

#### Fitting Room Management (Manager Only):
- `GET /api/fitting-room-requests/rooms` - Get all fitting rooms
- `GET /api/fitting-room-requests/rooms/status` - Get fitting room status
- `GET /api/fitting-room-requests/rooms/available` - Get available rooms

## 🎯 Benefits of Single Controller

### 1. Simplified Architecture
- ✅ **One controller** instead of two
- ✅ **Clear organization** by user type
- ✅ **Easier maintenance** and understanding

### 2. Better API Structure
```
/api/fitting-room-requests/
├── POST                    # Create request (Customer)
├── GET                     # Get all requests (Manager)
├── GET /my-requests        # Get my requests (Customer)
├── GET /status/{status}    # Get by status (Manager)
├── GET /{requestId}        # Get specific (Manager)
├── PUT /{requestId}        # Update request (Manager)
├── GET /rooms              # Get all rooms (Manager)
├── GET /rooms/status       # Get room status (Manager)
└── GET /rooms/available    # Get available rooms (Manager)
```

### 3. Improved Code Organization
```csharp
#region Customer Endpoints
// Customer-specific endpoints

#region Manager Endpoints  
// Manager-specific endpoints

#region Fitting Room Management (Manager Only)
// Room management endpoints
```
